The AQI Predictor is a deep learning model trained on a dataset containing pollutant concentrations (PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene) and AQI values from major Indian cities between 2015 and 2020. The model predicts the AQI and provides visualizations to analyze the pollutants in the atmosphere.
